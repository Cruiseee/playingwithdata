# Playing with Data

This repository contains sample code and data, as well as links to the P5.js
editor, associated with the [Playing With Data](https://cdh.princeton.edu/events/2019/02/playing-data/)
series of workshops hosted by the
Princeton [Center for Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu) and
the [Council on Science and Technology Studio Lab](https://cst.princeton.edu/studiolab).


## Data Files

The data files can be downloaded for use from this repository or used in
in web application directly via CDN. They are found in the `data` folder.

All are in CSV format with one header row.

### Latin American Ephemera datasets

These files are generated from the Princeton Libraries
[Latin American Ephemera](https://lae.princeton.edu/) collection and list
the number of items for given country and subject bucketed into two year
increments.

The file names follow the pattern `country_name_of_subject`.

### Shakespeare and Co. Datasets

These files use preliminary data from the
[Shakespeare and Company Project](https://cdh.princeton.edu/projects/shakespeare-and-company-project/),
which collects the lending cards and log books of Sylvia Beach's
Shakespeare and Company lending library, a hotbed for American expatriates
and literary life in Paris during the early twentieth century.

`s-co_members_by_year.csv` details the number of members added per year.
`s-co_members_by_yearmonth.csv` details the number of members added by year and month.
